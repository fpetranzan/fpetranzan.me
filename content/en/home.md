<p>I'm a Software Engineer on a constantly evolving journey, driven by curiosity and the desire to achieve increasingly ambitious goals. My experience primarily focuses on back-end development, where I've worked on complex projects with a particular emphasis on performance, security, and scalable, efficient solutions.</p>

<p>I've contributed to the development of complex software solutions, working on microservices architectures as well. My activities have ranged from query optimization to caching systems integration, with the goal of improving application performance and scalability. Additionally, I've gained experience on large-scale projects with high traffic volumes, tackling challenges related to concurrency management and system efficiency. This journey has allowed me to refine technical skills in technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, SQL, Docker, Redis, Python, and Git, while also developing strong problem-solving abilities. I've also deepened my knowledge in the e-commerce domain, obtaining the <SAP_Commerce_Cloud>SAP Certified Professional - Developer for SAP Commerce Cloud <linkIcon></linkIcon></SAP_Commerce_Cloud> certification, which enabled me to specialize in developing enterprise commercial platforms.</p>

<p>For me, software development is more than a job: it's a passion that drives me to continuously challenge myself. I enjoy collaborating with the team, sharing ideas, and tackling challenges together, always with the goal of creating clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Adopting practices such as code reviews and automated testing is part of my approach to ensuring quality and reliability in projects.</p>

<p>I'm constantly engaged in exploring new technologies and topics, with the goal of expanding my knowledge and skills. Recently, I obtained the <OCI_Developer>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2025 Certified Developer Professional <linkIcon></linkIcon></OCI_Developer> certification, consolidating my skills in cloud-native development, and the <OCI_AI>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2025 Certified AI Foundations Associate <linkIcon></linkIcon></OCI_AI> certification, through which I've begun exploring the world of artificial intelligence and its practical applications.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I'm a curious person. I love billiards, movies and TV series, and I've practiced various sports such as soccer, swimming, ping pong... now I regularly go to the gym. I like animals, especially dogs, and in the past I've also cultivated a passion for music, playing the guitar.</p>

<p>When I'm not busy writing code, I dedicate myself to studying and improving my skills, exploring new projects. I believe that curiosity and the desire to learn are the keys to growth, both professionally and personally.</p>
