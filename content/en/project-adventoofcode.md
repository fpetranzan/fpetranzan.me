<p>The Advent of Code is an annual event featuring a series of programming puzzles posted daily from Dec. 1 to Dec. 25.</p><p>It's a perfect opportunity to improve my coding skills, take on logic challenges, and have fun solving increasingly complex problems.</p><p>In 2024, I participated using Java as my language, successfully completing the puzzles until December 12.</p><p>Each day was an exciting challenge that allowed me to test my skills with new logic and algorithms, pushing me to find efficient and creative solutions.</p>
