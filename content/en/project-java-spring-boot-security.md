<p>This project represents a comprehensive security system, developed using the Spring Boot framework and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization management.</p><p>Main features implemented include user registration, email verification, login, password recovery, two-factor authentication, and logout.</p><p>For data management, I used a MySQL database, while Spring Security was employed to implement role-based permissions.</p><p>Passwords are protected through the BCrypt algorithm, ensuring a high level of security.</p><p>In addition, I customized unauthorized access management to improve the user experience and strengthen protection.</p>
