<p>Java Memory Game is my first complex project developed during my studies. It is a digital version of the classic 'Memory' game, implemented in Java 8 using Java Swing.</p><p>The game includes several modes (single player, two players, against the computer), difficulty levels (4x4, 6x6, 8x8), and a save/reload system for games. </p><p>Additional features such as timed turn management and dynamic scoring make the experience more challenging and addictive.</p><p>Although it has some bugs and room for improvement, this project represents an important milestone in my software development journey.</p>
