<p>Personal portfolio, created with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, with the aim of being simple and functional.</p><p>The structure includes a home that tells who I am, a section dedicated to professional experiences, and a showcase of my projects.</p><p>Among the features, it offers a choice between light and dark theme and supports two languages (Italian and English) to ensure global usability. </p><p>The site is designed as a showcase displaying who I am, my experiences, and my work.</p><p>For this reason, I opted for a minimalist style, with essential functionality, to allow for greater focus on content and easier reading.</p>
