<p>The project allows users to explore and filter Italian municipalities through multiple socio-economic parameters provided by ISTAT: population, area, average income, number of university students, bank branches, resident foreigners, and other demographic indicators.</p>
<p>Users can apply combined filters, search for specific municipalities, or filter by region, viewing the results on an interactive map with geolocated pins.</p>
<p>The architecture is based on a Next.js frontend for the user interface, a Java Spring Boot backend for application logic, PostgreSQL for data persistence, and Redis as a caching layer to optimize performance.</p>
<p>ISTAT data is updated annually through manual import and automated processing.</p>
<p>The website includes an information section showing the reference year of each dataset, accessible in detail for each municipality, as well as a dedicated page for user reports, feedback, and suggestions.</p>
<p>Born from a personal interest in ISTAT open data, the project aims to be an accessible exploration tool for anyone interested in discovering the characteristics of Italian territories.</p>
